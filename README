  DECOR APPLICATION MACHINERY
  (c) Vladi Belperchinov-Shabanski "Cade"
  
  Decor is set of libraries and support resources to build client-server
  information systems. Decor automates vast part of routine work:
  
    * database structuring
    * user management
    * security management
    * business logic security and execution
    * client-server data interaction (server api, client api, protocols)
    * data entry and other client-side forms/screens management

  Decor automates further those tasks with:
  
    * single-source DB structure and data-input objects description
    * online restructuring of the database schema on demand
    * security policies constructor and automatic checks
    * automatic data-entry objects/screens generation
    * user server session management
    * user, page/screen and linked-data client session management
  
  Decor is written entirely in Perl 5, but client apps can be in any language.

  Decor is licensed under GPLv2, for full text see file "COPYING".
  
  Further documentation will follow shortly.
